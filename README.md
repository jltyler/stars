# Stars
## What is this?
This project is a simple client-side javascript app that will draw a "starfield". The app creates lines that originate in the center of the page and move outwards.
Many attributes of these drawn lines can be controlled by writing functions in the provided text boxes.

Some info on what can be done inside the functions is listed on the help page of the app.
